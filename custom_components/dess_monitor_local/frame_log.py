"""In-memory ring buffer of raw transport frames.

Captures the last few responses received from each inverter command so
they're available for retrieval via the HA "Download Diagnostics" button.
Critical for debugging field-shift / parser / CRC issues where the only
authoritative evidence is the exact bytes the inverter sent.

Implementation choices:

* Module-level dict (rather than ``hass.data``) so transports can call
  ``record()`` without threading ``hass`` through every protocol class.
  Single-tenant integration, so no isolation concerns.
* Buffer per command (QPIGS / QPIRI / GS / …) keeps related frames
  together; ``maxlen=20`` covers ~3 minutes at the default 10-second
  poll interval — enough to catch a transient anomaly while staying
  well under any reasonable memory budget.
* Both hex and printable-ASCII representations are recorded — hex for
  byte-exact reproduction, ASCII for at-a-glance human reading.
